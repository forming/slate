# Introduction

## What is Phore?

Phore is a digital privacy cryptocurrency with a focus on sustainable development and growth. Phore uses Proof of Stake and Masternodes to secure the network and provide for a deep level of privacy and security. Phore has relatively fast block times compared with Bitcoin and low transaction fees.

## History

Phore is a digital privacy cryptocurrency, an update and rebrand of KryptKoin (KTK) which was
pre-announced in May 2014, and whose distribution started on the 21st May 2014.
Kryptkoin was a non-premined coin, distributed equally to people who qualified for a stake. In
total, 500 stakes were distributed in 2 stages. Bonus KTK was given to those who held for 30
days. There was no ICO, and no dev premine. The developer received 1 stake, the same as
every other stakeholder received. Following launch, Kryptkoin quickly developed a large
following and introduced an online marketplace in 2015, which included Paypal integration
where digital items such as Wordpress themes and physical items such as clothes were both
listed and bought.
To facilitate new features, the existing code needed to be rewritten from scratch. This required
a swap from Kryptkoin to the new Phore.
A two-month window was given to existing KTK holders to swap their coins for new Phore on a
1:1 basis.

## Team

The coin has a strong and committed team:
    ● Phroshi - Lead Developer
    ● Julian - Core Developer
    ● Fish313 - Technical Support & Social Media Manager
    ● Toby - Customer Relations & Social Media Manager
    ● Shanto - Community Manager & Customer Relations
    ● Liray - Technical Support & Japanese Community Manager
    ● Ubermaster - Planning and Partnerships

We will hire more staff and developers to strengthen our team as the Phore expands and
evolves.

## Roadmap

Phore is a restless currency.
The key challenge going forward is to introduce real-world use which attract everyday
people. In order to achieve this, Phore will implement advanced features to clearly differentiate
Phore from other privacy based digital currencies.
A number of these will add to the functionality and strategic integration of the online
marketplace, which will be built on the current foundations of Phore.
Governance will determine many of the goals going forward to keep the currency decentralized, but a decrease in Master node rewards per block is expected to decrease
inflation.

## Short Term (Q3 - Q4, 2017)

    ● Masternode Governance - Those with Masternodes would be given ‘yes’ or ‘no’ votes
    using commands built into Phore wallets. Decentralized governance will allow a cryptocurrency
    network to grow, and incorporate democratic procedures that will ensure the
    longevity of the project, leading to a truly decentralized management system.
    ● Online Marketplace - UI compatibility for all devices.
